    <p class="text-center">Stocks are a key part of the financial world! Here's a dive into their story and how they work:</p>
    <div class="container mt-5 p-5">
      <h3 class="text-warning">What Are Stocks?</h3>
      <p>Stocks (or shares) represent ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you own a small piece of that company.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Example: If you buy 10 shares of Tesla, you become a partial owner of Tesla, and your share is proportional to the number of shares the company has issued.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-warning">How Stocks Work</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Initial Public Offering (IPO)
          <ul>
            <li>Companies sell stocks to the public for the first time through an IPO.</li>
            <li>Example: Facebook went public in 2012 to raise funds for expansion.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Trading on Stock Exchanges
          <ul>
            <li>Once issued, stocks are traded on stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq.</li>
            <li>Buyers and sellers negotiate prices based on supply and demand.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Stock Value
          <ul>
            <li>Stock prices fluctuate due to company performance, market conditions, and investor sentiment.</li>
            <li>Example: If a company reports high profits, its stock price might rise because of increased demand.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class="text-warning">Types of Stocks</h3>

            <li>Gives voting rights at shareholder meetings.</li>
            <li>May pay dividends (a portion of company profits).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Preferred Stocks
          <ul>
            <li>No voting rights, but fixed dividends are paid before common stockholders.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class="text-warning">Why Do People Buy Stocks?</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Example: Amazon's stock price was $18 at its IPO in 1997. As of 2024, it’s worth thousands!</li>
          </ul>
