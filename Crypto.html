      <h1 class="text-warning mt-5">What are Cryptocurrencies?</h1>
      <p class="text-secondary">Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for secure financial transactions. They are decentralized, meaning they are not controlled by any central authority or institution. Instead, they are based on blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent way.</p>
      <p class="text-secondary">Cryptocurrencies are often used for peer-to-peer transactions, such as buying and selling goods or services, or for investing in digital assets. Some popular cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.</p>

      <h1 class="text-warning mt-5">Types of Cryptocurrencies</h1>
      <p class="text-secondary">There are different types of cryptocurrencies, each with its own unique features and use cases. Here are some of the main types:</p>
      <ul class="list-style-numbered">
        <li>Bitcoin (BTC):
          <p>Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency, created in 2009. It’s often seen as “digital gold” due to its limited supply (21 million coins) and serves as a store of value. Bitcoin uses a decentralized, peer-to-peer network to process and verify transactions, which makes it secure and difficult to counterfeit. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses blockchain technology to secure transactions.</p>

      <h1 class="text-warning">Key Features</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Decentralization: No central authority controls cryptocurrencies; they run on a distributed network of computers.</li>
        <li>Blockchain: A public ledger that records all transactions securely and transparently.</li>
        <li>Cryptography: Ensures transactions are secure and prevents counterfeiting.</li>
      </ol>
      <h1 class="text-warning">How Does It Work?</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>The Blockchain
          <ul>
            <li>Think of a blockchain as a digital ledger.</li>
            <li>Every transaction is grouped into a "block."</li>
            <li>Once a block is full, it's added to a chain of previous blocks, creating an immutable history.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Mining
          <ul>
            <li>For some cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, transactions are validated through a process called mining.</li>
            <li>Miners solve complex mathematical problems to verify transactions and add them to the blockchain.</li>
            <li>In return, miners are rewarded with new cryptocurrency coins.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Wallets
          <ul>
            <li>To use cryptocurrency, you need a wallet.</li>
            <li>A wallet stores your private and public keys.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Private Key: Allows you to access and spend your crypto.</li>
              <li>Public Key: Acts like your account number for receiving funds.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <h1 class="text-warning">Transactions</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>When you send cryptocurrency, your wallet uses your private key to sign the transaction.</li>
          <li>Miners or validators confirm the transaction, and it’s added to the blockchain.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h1 class="text-warning">Popular Cryptocurrencies</h1>
