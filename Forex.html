        <h3 class="text-warning">Key Concepts in Forex</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Currency Pairs:
            <p>In forex, currencies are traded in pairs (like EUR/USD or GBP/JPY), representing the value of one currency relative to another. The first currency in the pair is the base currency, and the second is the quote currency. When you see a quote of EUR/USD = 1.10, it means 1 Euro is worth 1.10 US dollars.The most common forex pairs are those involving the US dollar (USD), the euro (EUR), the Japanese yen (JPY), the British pound (GBP), and the Australian dollar (AUD).</p>
          </li>
          <li>Exchange Rates:
            <p>The exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another. These rates fluctuate constantly based on supply and demand, influenced by factors like interest rates, economic data, political events, and global market sentiment.The exchange rate is the price at which one currency can be exchanged for another. It is typically quoted as the amount of the base currency that is needed to purchase one unit of the quote currency.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Leverage and Margin:
            <p>Forex traders often use leverage, which allows them to control larger positions with a smaller amount of money. For example, 10:1 leverage means a $100 investment can control a $1,000 position. This can magnify both profits and losses, so it’s considered high-risk.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Types of Forex Markets:
            <ul>
              <li>Spot Market: The immediate (or “spot”) exchange of currency pairs at the current market rate.</li>
              <li>Forward Market: Contracts are made to buy or sell a currency at a future date for a set price, allowing for hedging against exchange rate fluctuations.</li>
              <li>Futures Market: Similar to forwards but more standardized and typically traded on exchanges.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

              <li>Swing Traders: Hold positions for several days to weeks, focusing on larger price movements.</li>
              <li>Position Traders: Hold positions for months or even years, often with a long-term view.</li>
            </ul>
