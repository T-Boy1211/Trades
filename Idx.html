      <h3 class="text-warning">What Is a Stock Index?</h3>
      <p>A stock index measures the performance of a group of stocks. It's like a report card for the stock market, showing how a particular segment (or the entire market) is doing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Example: The S&P 500 tracks the performance of the 500 largest companies in the U.S.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-warning">How Indexes Work</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Composition:
          <ul>
            <li>An index includes specific companies or assets based on certain criteria (like size or sector).</li>
            <li>Example: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) includes 30 large, U.S.-based companies.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>        
        <li>Weighting:
          <ul>
            <li>Market-Cap Weighted: Larger companies have more influence (e.g., S&P 500).</li>
            <li>Price Weighted: Higher-priced stocks carry more weight (e.g., Dow Jones).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use Cases:
          <ul>
            <li>Investing: Investors buy index funds or ETFs to mimic the index's performance.</li>
            <li>Benchmarking: Active managers compare their performance to indexes.</li>
