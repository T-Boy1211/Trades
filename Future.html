      <h3 class="text-warning">What Are Futures?</h3>
      <p>Futures are financial contracts where two parties agree to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on a future date. They’re used to hedge against price changes or to speculate for profit.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Example:
          <p>Imagine a farmer growing wheat. He worries the price might drop when his crop is ready. A bread company, on the other hand, fears prices might rise. They enter a futures contract:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Farmer locks in a price to sell his wheat.</li>
            <li>Bread company locks in a price to buy it.</li>
            <p>Both sides protect themselves from price volatility.</p>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-warning">How Futures Work</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Underlying Assets: Futures contracts can be based on commodities (like oil or gold), financial instruments (like stock indexes), or even cryptocurrencies.</li>
        <li>Leverage: You can trade futures with a small upfront investment (called margin), controlling larger positions—but this amplifies both gains and losses.</li>
        <li>Settlement: At the contract’s end, the buyer either receives the actual asset (physical delivery) or the cash difference in value (cash settlement).</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class="text-warning">History of Futures</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Ancient Roots
          <ul>
            <li>Futures trading began in Japan in the 1600s with rice farmers. Farmers and merchants used rice futures to stabilize prices.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)
          <ul>
            <li>Established in 1848, CBOT became the first modern futures exchange, starting with grain contracts.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Modern Evolution
          <ul>
            <li>Futures now cover a wide range of assets, from crude oil to Bitcoin.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Financial Futures
          <ul>
